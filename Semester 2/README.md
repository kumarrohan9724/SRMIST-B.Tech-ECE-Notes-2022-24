## How to Learn?

### Advanced Calculus and Complex Analysis

- Solve with Teacher in the Class from the starting.
- Try and do question by yourself also in between, that way you'll have an idea of what to do before the exams even start.
- Use the Tutorial sheets that your professors share, that's more than enough to prepare for exams.

#### Resources:

---

### Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering

- The first unit you'll cover the same stuff that you did back in school.
- Most of this subject is very numerical based, it might seem tough but keep practicing it and you'll get a hang of how to solve the problems.
- There's a practical component to this as well. Whatever you do in theory, you'll be doing in breadboards as well. 
- Frequently practice the numericals to avoid burn in the last few days before exam.

#### Resources:

---

### Engineering Graphics and Drawing

- Take AutoCAD not the drawing option. Trust me, this will save you tons of time.
- At first AutoCAD might seem very confusing, once you make a few prototypes, you'll get a hang of it. 
- Learn Shortcuts, they'll save you tons time.

#### Resources:

---

### English

- Basic school engligh. Nothing much to worry about. 
- You can study for this just a day before exam also.

---

### General Aptitude

- This is important if your're looking for placements.
- The subject might seem boring, but just focus here and get a hang of how to solve things.
- If there's one thing that you should be consistent with, it's this. 

---

### Physics - Electromagnetic Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Waves

- Most units start with what you've already studied in school.
- It's interesting as long as you don't let external factors influence you.
- Practical component is present, so keep an eye out for it.

#### Resources:

---

### Yoga

- Honestly don't know what happened here, I had it online. If anyone has offline experience, please share here how you did it!

---

### Constitution of India

- I found this boring, but you can learn it quickly just for the sake of clearning the exam.
- Don't worry much about remembering the details, you can always google it up later.
