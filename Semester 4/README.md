## How to Learn?

### Probability and Stochasitc Processes

- Take notes during class.
- Make sure you're noting down all the formulas.
- If you're familiar with basic single and double integration, differentiation and basic Jacobians, then it will be quite easy.
- Practice the tutorial sheets shared by your professors.

#### Resources:

---

### Linear Integrated Systems

- Makes notes for this subject.
- It has an intermediate difficulty. Some derivations are tough to learn.
- It's comparatively easier to other Electronics subject of this semester.
- Start preparing for this subject one week early.

#### Resources:

---

### Biology

- Easy for some, tough for others. If you've taken Bio back in +1 and +2, then this subject should be just one day before preparation.
- Practice diagrams once or twice before test.
- Keep the mechanisms and key words highlighed in the paper.

#### Resources:

---

### Analog Electronic Circuits

- Definitely take notes!
- Derivations are tough, so keep practicing them.
- Numerial Problems are easier, but most of them depend on you knowing the derivations to solve the numericals.
- Start preparing for this subject one week early.

#### Resources:

---

### Management Principles

- Can prepare a night before exam, however lots to read, so start a day or two earlier.

---

### Critical and Creative Thinking Skills

- Same as what you did in last semesters Competencies in Social Skills subject. 
- Indepth practice of aptitide questions. 
- If you're going for placements this is important.

---

### Optoelectronics

- Take notes during class. 
- Similar numericals will be asked during exams, only with different values.
- Diagrams are important for the exam paper.
- Prepare one week earlier.

#### Resources:

---

### Advanced Digital System Design

- TBD.

---

### Application of Nanotechnology

- Can prepare one day before the exam.
- Some topics diagrams are important.
- Cover all the notes, despite being lenghty, they will help out in the MCQs and 1 mark type questions.
