## How to Learn?

### Control Systems

- First 3 units and easy to catch on and solve problems with.
- Focus and take notes for this subject.
- Practice frequenly. The last two units will require your attention.

#### Resources:

---

### Digital Electronic Principles

- Take notes.
- Simple if you can work with quick conversions and understand the basic logic of how gates work.
- Solve few problems by yourself to get a proper hang of this subject.

#### Resources:

---

### Electromagnetics and Transmission Lines

- MUST take notes.
- This subject is full of derivations and not the ones you had at school.
- Recommneded to refer to this subject on a weekly basis as there is a lot to cover.

#### Resources:

---

### Electronic Devices

- MUST take notes.
- Lot's of derivations here and theory as well. 
- The first 3 units will be a bit tough, but the last wo is quite application based so you can learn it easily.

#### Resources:

---

### Signals and Systems

- Foucs on the first unit here and the rest 3 will be easy to follow with.
- Last two units is pretty similar to what you'll cover in Transforms and Boundary Value Problems. 
- Make notes and practice by yourself.

#### Resources:

---

### Social Engineering

- You can study for this a day before exams.

---

### Transforms and Boundary Value Problems

- Solve with Teacher in the Class from the starting.
- Try and do question by yourself also in between, that way you'll have an idea of what to do before the exams even start.
- Use the Tutorial sheets that your professors share, that's more than enough to prepare for exams.

#### Resources:

---

### Environmental Science

- You can study for this a day before exams.

---

### Competencies in Social Skills

- Same as what you did in last years General Aptitude subject. 
- Indepth practice of aptitide questions. 
- If you're going for placements this is important.
